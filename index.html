                  It's caused by a virus called coronavirus. It was discovered
                  in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.

                  Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever,
                  cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more
                  severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute
                  respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.

                  regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing
                  and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs. Avoid close
